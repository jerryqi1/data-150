Read this press article on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure development plan. What are your thoughts, or more saliently, what questions do you have or what would you want to know/learn more about? What responsibilities do you think the international community should have (if any) on such matters? You have until 10:10.
Recent years, China has increased cooperation with many African developing countries, as a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. According to the journal, China has lots of official borrowing and it is a hidden truth under the Belt and Road Initiative. I think for lots of the world’s countries, including developed countries, have lots of official borrowing too. It is a common way to guarantee a country’s normal development. It is, in some way confined the development to African countries and potential corruptions may have worsened that point. However, I think it is generally good when it comes to the Belt and Road Initiative. Firstly, I think it can facilitate the international cooperation between China and African countries, including more international trades and better international relationships.
Secondly, during BRI, China brought its technology like highway trains and some building techniques to Africa, which benefits the construction of fundamental infrastructure in African developing countries. 
Finally, the cooperation brought huge amount of job opportunities to African society, which in some ways pushed the society forward.
