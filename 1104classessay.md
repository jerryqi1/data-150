11/4 Essay:Â We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable. I will read your responses later today. You have until 10:05.


My favorite data science topic is about environment (geospatial data science). In this field the models always include maps with different colors representing different countries. I think this kind of charts can show the information clearly, making it easy to understand and compare. Also, the environment is closely related human development. When I was doing my homework assignments, I read lots of articles about environment. It turns out that protecting environment is very important to the economy. How to coexist with the nature is always a hot topic and if we can make good use of the natural resources without harming it too much, human development will accelerate greatly. Also I think the environment usually connects with other fields of science like chemistry, physics and geography, which extends to further interesting knowledge.
I recommend a passage discussing the coastal vulnerabilities to different disasters on the coast of Bangladesh.

It used clear images and perfect data science methods to divide the whole process of assessing vulnerabilities into three steps. It is really a good piece of information on geospatial data science.
