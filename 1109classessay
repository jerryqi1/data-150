When it comes to the benefits of the technology of facial recognition, it in some ways is more convenient because it can replace passwords and fingerprints, saving people’s time.

In order to connect with others, people usually provide their names, locations and other personal information using the face recognition system. However, it also expose their personal privacy under great threats. As an access of one’s personal privacy, facial information is not as safe as passwords and fingerprints because there are lots of similar faces and can be confused if the system is not well developed enough.
