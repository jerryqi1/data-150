9/28 class essay: I'd like to get to know you better. What is your general background---in a few sentences, what do you want me to know about you? What are your interests academically, intellectually, or professionally? Basically, what do you care about (no wrong answers here)? What do you think data science is? Based on your conception of data science, in a very broad sense, how (if at all) do you think it can be harnessed to improve the lives of people (their quality of life), the environment, our understanding of ourselves or nature, business & economics, everyday problem solving, or anything else?


Hello! My name is Jerry qi, and I come from China. Before I came to Walliam and Mary, I have been to the US once as a tourist. My academic interest is Chemistry and in my spare time, I like playing sports. For now, I basically care about how can I get used to the academic environment here as soon as possible. I also care about my family faraway in my hometown. I think data science is the subject that use focus on analyzing data behind different problems and use the analysis to solve different problems. By using graphs and charts, people can see thing more clearly and can also find potential laws in some complex problems. Using data science methods, people can see further through the question and therefore figure out more effective ways to solve it. Data scientists, by analzing a great amount of information, select the most useful data and use them to improve human lives. Sometimes, the weather can be predicted by studying different cloud shapes and wind currents. Disasters like forest fires can be prevented by taking protective measures based on former experiences. Wise economic policies can be published by studying the economic models which contian huge amount of data. Data science can help people in many ways.
