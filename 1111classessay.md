11/11 Essay: Read this October 2020 article from UPenn that's a set of statements by faculty from a broad array of fields on the ways in which data and data science are contributing to or affecting their field with respect to COVID and the pandemic (hat tip to Rhea).Write 1-2 paragraphs on the following: From what you know about your prospective major, what is a permanent or semi-permanent way the pandemic has affected your field of study or an aspect of culture or society related to your field? Do you believe the change is a net-positive or negative for society and why? What recommendations (if any) would you have for your field moving forward on the issue? For example, if you're a prospective business major, what are your thoughts on remote work and the use of office spaces and how businesses could think about "where" to work moving forward? Or, if you're a prospective psychology or sociology major, how has the virus and pandemic changed how people and societies view and react to germs? You have until 10:05.
  

The pandemic influenced a lot in the field of Chemistry, especially biochemistry. From the beginning of the pandemic, scientists have been studying the characteristic of the corona virus: its structure, its infectivity, and its seriousness and possible damage it can deal with human body. From the early phase of the pandemic, scientists have been studying and developing the vaccine of COVID but they devote more of their time focusing on how to control the pandemic. At that time, hospitals were all full and doctors worked day and night. The experts in biochemistry also tried their best to study the virus and think about how to slow down the infection. Everyone wore a mask outdoors but people spend most of their time at home. The isolation policy worked since it stopped the infection effectively. 


About 1 year after the burst of the pandemic, when the pandemic was controlled well and the new patients and deaths per day stayed in an acceptable range, scientists turned their focus on developing the vaccine of the pandemic. There are several generations of vaccines. During innumerable experiments, vaccine shots were made available to people. I think in the chemistry field, the pandemic did have some negative effects on its development because the pandemic affected the normal pace of life in every aspects. However, the pandemic also facilitated the technology development. The COVID emergency pushed scientists to work more. Up till now, significant developments have been made on the vaccine and cure of the corona virus.
